# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Sneh, your friendly neighborhood CS nerd.

Iâ€™m interested in coding, swimming, and speedcubing(my PB is 15.xx secs hehe).

I like gen-z memes too! *Frog in the supermarket, what will he buy?* 

Hereâ€™s a list on what Iâ€™m upto rn:

- **ðŸ“š Learning:** MERN Stack (Currently on React).
- ðŸ”¬ **Working on:** `please check out later :)`
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I use Arch btw.
